# Magical String

Problem Link :- [Link]()

<h3>
Problem :- A magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

   * The string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.
  
The first few elements of s is s = "1221121221221121122……". If we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be "1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are "1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......". You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.

Given an integer n, return the number of 1's in the first n number in the magical string s.

**Solution :-**
```
class Solution {
public:
    int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return n;
        vector<int> dp(n+1);
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        int res = 1;
        int end = 1;
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            if (end < i) end += dp[++j+1];
            dp[i] = j % 2 + 1;
            if (j % 2 == 0) res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
