Problem Link :- [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-popular-video-creator/)

<h3>
Problem :- You are given two string arrays creators and ids, and an integer array views, all of length n. The ith video on a platform was created by creator[i], has an id of ids[i], and has views[i] views.

The popularity of a creator is the sum of the number of views on all of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the highest popularity and the id of their most viewed video.

  * If multiple creators have the highest popularity, find all of them.
  
  * If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically smallest id.
  
Return a 2D array of strings answer where answer[i] = [creatori, idi] means that creatori has the highest popularity and idi is the id of their most popular video. The answer can be returned in any order.
